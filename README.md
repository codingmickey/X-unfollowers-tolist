## Pros:
- Doesn't use the super pricey X API so it's FREE of cost for anyone to run it

## Cons:
- Need to keep the tab open and cannot interfere with it
- Takes time for this to run, especially with profiles with large following/not following back ratio
- Code is *very* crap, I tried to learn and build it so .. (but the user doesn't care, con for me)


# Have fun clearing your following into a list :D



### Context (Story)

I am traveling in a train with a very unstable connection so was pretty bored and then I remembered to make this. As was very unsatisfied by the chatgpt X API reply that I gave to this tweet yesterday after 15mins of playing around.
